					<h2>Hi there!</h2>
			
					<p>I am a product designer with a front-end developer background. My passion is to elevate strategy and design to create products that are more user-centric and viable. I love to solve abstract problems into easy and simple solutions through empathy with users perspective.</p>
					<p>In my spare time, I go for a walk, meditation and watch movies. Photography is one of my favourites. </p>
